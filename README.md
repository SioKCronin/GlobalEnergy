Global Energy is an exploratory data analsyis of the International Energy Agency's IEA Headline Energy Data, which includes product data for 14 energy balance flows in kilotons of oil equivalent (ktoe) for 9 energy products over the years 1971-2014.

The IEA is an independent agency that works closely with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental economic organisation with 35 member countries, founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade (Wikipedia "OECD" 11/15/16).

This analysis began with an overview of US energy imports, shifted to a deeper look at US oil and crude, drew comparisons to world crude flow, and ended with a look at regional net flow.

This dataset can be downloaded from the IEA's website: https://www.iea.org/statistics/
